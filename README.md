# FitnessTrackerApp

This Fitness Tracker App is written using NodeJS, mustache templates and NeDB.

To build this app, you need to ensure that node.js is installed on your local machine. After these are installed, clone the repo to local folder. Open project and run commands in terminal:

npm install

Running this commands allows the project dependancies.

Once these commands have ran successfully, the nodemon index command will build and run the application locally, to run on localhost:3000.

Third Party Libraries

Bootstrap - bootstrap gives us a selection of pre-designed components and layout styles to rapidly bring together an interface. Bootstrap is an excellent starting point as the developers can all access the same components from the beginning. But as the projects progress, we can define a unique approach rather than using bootstrap and would be the first steps towards crafting our own design system which would be used instead of bootstrap in the future.
